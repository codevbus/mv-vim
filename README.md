# Mike Vanbuskirk's VIM config

This repo stores my vim files/configs/plugins etc...

It's a culmination of things that I've borrowed, cobbled together, and learned over the years.

I use the amazing [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) for plugin management.

Plugins that exist as Git repos have been initialized as [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

Happy Vim'ing!
