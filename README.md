# Mike Vanbuskirk's VIM config

This repo stores my vim files/configs/plugins etc...

It's a culmination of things that I've borrowed, cobbled together, and learned over the years.

## **New Workflow - 10/24/17**

I've made a major refresh to my plugins, vimrc, and overall workflow. Inspiration and configuration
was taken from Ian Langworth's excellent [article](https://statico.github.io/vim3.html). Highly
recommended read.

Still using [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) for plugin
management.

This configuration now generally depends on Vim8.

I've started using the vanilla Terminal app on OSX, in lieu of iTerm2. I also
aim to start including Tmux in my workflow as well.

Plugins that exist as Git repos have been initialized as [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

Happy Vim'ing!
